# Customer-Propensity-Modelling
A propensity model is a model that predicts the likelihood that someone will do something. Propensity modeling allows you to allocate your resources more wisely, resulting in greater efficiencies, while achieving better results. 
<ul>
<li>The likelihood that website visitors will register an account.
<li>The likelihood that a registered user will pay and subscribe.
<li>The likelihood that a user will refer another user. </ul> 
As well, propensity modeling does not only entail “who” and “what” — it also entails “when” (when should you target the users you’ve identified) and “how” (how should you deliver your message to your targeted users?). <br> <br>
To give an example, think of this: instead of sending an email advertisement where there’s a 0%-100% chance of a user clicking it, with propensity modeling, you can target users with a 50%+ chance of clicking it. Fewer emails, more conversions!
